- Small parts dropped can go throught the ground or explode. I recommend to always drop this parts on another part (container for exemple) to avoid this issue
- Item drag from part list to inventory in editor can be stuck after loading a vessel (click on the inventory UI to fix the problem)
- Kerbal inventory portrait is missing after going on the map (save/load to fix)
