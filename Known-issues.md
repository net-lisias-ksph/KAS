- Small parts dropped can go throught the ground or explode. I recommend to avoid dropping them on the ground, and instead drop them on another part (container for exemple)
- Item drag from part list to inventory in editor can be stuck after loading a vessel (click on the inventory UI to fix the problem)
- Kerbal inventory portrait is missing after going on the map (save/load to fix)
